# 2048 game
Java Implementation of the 2048 game

## Controls

- Use UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move the tiles.
- Use SPACEBAR to restart the game after it's over.

## Rules

You have a 4x4 board divided into square tiles. A tile with a value of 2 (probability of 90%) or 4 (probability of 10%) appears in each round. All the tiles can be moved to one of the four sides. If two tiles with the same value "collide", they merge and the tile value doubles. The objective is to get a tile whose value is 2048. The player loses if another move is no longer possible.
